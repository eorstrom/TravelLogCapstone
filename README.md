# Travel Log Capstone

### Description
This app is my full-stack cummulative project for the Nashville Software School program. It's goal is to be able to allow users to track their visits to different locations, such as restaurants, museums, parks, and the like and write a personal review for reference later. Like a journal entry. For MVP purposes, I stuck with only searching for and saving restaurant names and addresses to the database.

As of writing this README on July 5th, 2016, the app is in it's very early stages of development. It can so far interact with a Google Map on the main page, and use the autocomplete function to search for places matching the string that a user types in, and then pull up the basic information (Name of location and Address) for that location when the user clicks on its icon on the map. The user should then type in the name of the location (sticking with restaurants as a start) and the location's address. 

### How to Run
This repo should be cloned along with my Travel-Log-Capstone-Client repo. This repo is the backend database, and the other repo is for the front-end, user interaction. Further instructions for running the program are in the Travel-Log-Capstone-Client repo.
